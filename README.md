# ⭐ My Space – A Digital Space to Share Unspoken Feelings

It is a heartfelt web application that allows users to send messages or thoughts to someone who is no longer with us by simply clicking on a star icon. It offers a meaningful and personal space to express emotions, memories, gratitude, or words left unsaid—helping users find comfort through expression.

This platform is built to be simple, emotional, and accessible for anyone seeking a quiet space to share their feelings.
